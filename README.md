## Doctor's Assistant (DASS)

When executing the DASS streamlit application after any changes have been made to the mock patient records, make sure to delete the "embedded_data.pkl" in the same folder (patientrecords) before executing it. 

This is to ensure that any new mock data is added to the embedded data file and any removed mock data is properly removed from the file.
