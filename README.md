## Doctor's Assistant (DASS)

When executing the DASS streamlit application after any changes have been made to the mock patient records, make sure to delete the "embedded_data.pkl" in the same folder (patientrecords). 

This is to ensure that any new mock data is added to the embed and any removed data is properly removed.
